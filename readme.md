Welcome to the discontinued TG20 website!
This is the "legacy" version of my website. 
It will occasionally be updated, but don't expect major changes at all. Hope ya'll enjoy my dumb funny site!

- TG20/TG20 Games (me): Code changes, icons, hosting itch.io games, most of the subpages, 404 page, fixes for Getting Over It Multiplayer,
